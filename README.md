This project was undertaken as a part of CSF212 DBMS under Professor Jayalakshmi of BITS PILANI Hyderabad.

The project was to make a university management system which should contain the following:

1. Minimum 3 table creation and insertion of atleast 5 tuples in each table.

2. Query for updating the tuples values based on criteria mentioned.
   
3. Query to retrieve the tuples based on Group by, Order by and Having clauses.
   
4. Queries to retrieve the tuples based on any two joins present in SQL.
   
5. Queries to retrieve the tuples based on atleast two aggregate functions.
    
6. Subqueries to retrieve the tuples.

P.S: miniproject2 still needs to be uploaded and updated
