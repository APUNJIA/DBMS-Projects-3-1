These projects were undertaken as a part of CSF212 DBMS under Professor Jayalakshmi of BITS PILANI Hyderabad.

The first project(miniproject1.sql) was to make a university management system which should contain the following:

1. Minimum 3 table creation and insertion of atleast 5 tuples in each table.

2. Query for updating the tuples values based on criteria mentioned.
   
3. Query to retrieve the tuples based on Group by, Order by and Having clauses.
   
4. Queries to retrieve the tuples based on any two joins present in SQL.
   
5. Queries to retrieve the tuples based on atleast two aggregate functions.
    
6. Subqueries to retrieve the tuples.

The second project(miniproject2.sql) was to take the tables from the previous miniproject and do the following:

1. Create a package that may either have a combination of procedure and function or only procedures/functions.
 
2. Atleast 2 procedures/functions should be there in the package.

3. Procedures and functions should only have DML operations (updation, insertion and deletion) along with the exceptions that handles the errors caused during the operation.
   
4. The DML should be done for more than one row/all rows present in the table.

5. Both before and after Triggers should be done for all DML operations

Apart from all this, we had to document all of our workings in a PDF format for both the miniprojects which had to be submitted to the instructor in charge. The people who worked on the project along with their ID numbers are:

1. Shaurya Agarwal (2021AAPS2047H)
2. Suchitra Sahu (2021A8PS2210H)
3. Ashrita Vaka Naidu (2021A3PS3061H)
4. Suchetana Mukherjee (2021AAPS0759H)
5. Aasheel Dave (2021A4PS3094H)
